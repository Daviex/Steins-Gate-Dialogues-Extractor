This tool has been created to extract dialogues from NSB files of the JUST USA Edition of the game. 

This tool was made for the Italian Steins;Gate Project!

If you use it, just mention where you took it from!

# How it works?
Simply. Build the project, move the nss folder you decompiled with the archive tool in the same folder as the executable and execute it, will create a folder called extracted.

Enjoy
